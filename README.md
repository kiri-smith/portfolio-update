# portfolio-update

For this project, I used HTML and CSS to create an updated portfolio. The portfolio contains my contact information, links to my github and linkedin accounts, and three showcased repositories/apps. I incorporated Materialize to style the portfolio and then added custom styling in the CSS document.
